   \brief   Basic macro to provide a skeleton and some base functionality for analysis macros

   Basic macro to provide a skeleton and some base functionality for analysis macros. Foreseen
   functionalities are open and close files and histogram handlig. We make use of the edm::PSet
   for configure our macros. The expected basic configuration is expected to contain the 
   following parameters (of fwlite configuration style):

   import FWCore.ParameterSet.Config as cms
   process = cms.Process("Plots")

   process.BasicMacro = cms.PSet(
    ## luminosity in pb-1
    lumi = cms.double(10)
    ## vector of input samples
    inputs = cms.VPSet(
      ## input file
      file  = cms.string('file:Sample1.root'),
      ## label in legend
      label = cms.string('legend entry'),
      ## normalization scale (expected to be to 1pb)
      scale = cms.double(0.123)
    ),
    ## histograms of interest
    hists = cms.vstring('fullpath/tohist',)

    This block may be imported from a central file and partiially replaced. In the BaseMacro class 
    it is foreseen that histograms of interest may be written inpto a single ps file (for overview 
    files), into single picture files (like .png -- nor validity check is applied yet) or into a
    new root file for further processing. It is expected that the (vectors of) Canvases and histo-
    grams are members of small derived classes with not more than 150 lines of code. They should 
    serve simple functionalities. Examples are given below:

    + plot a certain (set of) histogram(s) (comaprison of data and MC/theory).
    + read a certain (set of) histogram(s) and print a readable output to file/shell (e.g. a table 
      of cross sections).
    + take a (set of) histogram(s) from different inputs divide them (to determine an efficiency) 
      and write the result into a new file.
    + take a (set of) histogram(s) from different inputs calculate a cross section from it and 
      write the result into a new file.
    + take a set of pre-evaluated systematic variations, which apply on an efficiency, combine them 
      binwise and write the result into a new file.
    + take a (set of) cross section histogram(s), apply bin center corrections and write the result 
      into a new file.
    + take a (set of) cross section histogram(s), add systematic uncertainties to it and write the 
      result inot a new file.

    It is recommended to divide each processing on the way to a cross section in as small portions as
    possible and to make the result of this step persistent in a new output file. You may thus apply 
    very localized changes and redo the calculations without doing everything from scratch over and 
    over again. It is further on recommended to have a (set of) script(s) at hand to run the basic 
    processes on a routine basis. It might be useful to keep the calculation of a central cross sec-
    tion value separated from the full maschienery for the evaluation of systematic uncertainties.
